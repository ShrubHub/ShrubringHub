# Description
Purpose: We combined individual datasets of shrub growth from sites around the tundra biome to explore the climate sensitivity of shrub growth.

Abstract: This dataset consists of tundra shrub growth data from 37 arctic and alpine sites in 9 countries, including 25 species, and ~42 000 annual growth records from 1821 individuals.

Summary: Rapid temperature increases in the tundra biome have been linked to increasing shrub dominance. Shrub expansion can modify climate by altering surface albedo, energy and water balance, and permafrost, yet the drivers of shrub growth remain poorly understood. Dendroecological data consisting of multi-decadal time series of annual shrub growth provide an underused resource to explore climate-growth relationships.

# Data use guidelines
Data are publically available using an Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 Generic copyright (CC BY-SA 2.5).  We ask that data users abide by the 5% rule, that for any future study for which a particular data contributor’s data makes up 5% or more of the final dataset, they will be informed about the study and offered to contribute to the publication. If the data contributor declines authorship they should be acknowledged as appropriate. In addition, the Myers-Smith et al. 2015 paper pand any relevant research papers using the data set should be cited.

# Data availability & access
A static version of the cleaned database (v. 1.0) will be maintained at the Polar Data Catalog (https://www.polardata.ca/pdcsearch/PDCSearch.jsp?doi_id=12131). A new version number will be assigned every time there is a database update, and old database versions will be archived for reference.
